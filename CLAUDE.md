# CLAUDE.md — ymca-autobook

Standing context + preferences for this project. **Read at the start of each session** and honor these without re-asking.

## Class & schedule preferences
- **Dislikes Restorative Yoga** — never recommend or auto-book it.
- **Likes Monday Les Mills CORE, Vinyasa Yoga, and Lift & H.I.I.T.** — keep booking all three.
- **No cap on classes per day.** Generally avoid back-to-back high-intensity; at most one HIIT-type class per day.
- **Don't add classes to the light days (Mon / Tue / Thu) unless asked** — currently left as-is on purpose.
- Prefer **same-branch** pairings; minimize cross-branch hops when suggesting additions.
- Branch by day: **Mon / Tue / Thu = Southwest**, **Wed = Northwest**, **Fri = Northwest (9:45 CORE) then Southwest (11:20 Lift & H.I.I.T.)**. IDs: Southwest = 1392, Northwest = 1388.

## Booking model
- `classes.yml` = recurring classes to auto-book. Booking opens ~7 days ahead, so each class's cron fires ~1 week before and books that future date.
- Away dates live in the **private** repo `thomashan1/ymca-private` (`pauses.yml`); supports an optional per-class `except:` list to keep booking specific classes on a paused day. The summary calendar greys out away days.
- Full Mon-Fri schedule (both branches, 8:30-15:00, no fee/dance/swim/senior/pickleball) is cached in `schedule_snapshot.json` in the private repo, refreshed daily by `.github/workflows/schedule-snapshot.yml` (`scripts/snapshot_schedule.py`). Read it instead of a live browse when just discussing/recommending classes — it has an `updated_at` timestamp; re-browse live only if it looks stale or a one-off dispatch is needed.
- Manual one-off booking: dispatch `book.yml` with `class_key=<key>` (this path ignores pauses).

## Summary emails
- **Mon / Wed / Fri ~12:07 AM PT** (early + off-peak to dodge GitHub's cron-queue delay).
- Mon = this week; Wed & Fri = this + next week. Date format M/D. Away days blocked out in the calendar.

## Notifications
- Native **GitHub iOS push, failures-only**. Don't add per-run success pings unless asked.

## Ground rules
- Always start from latest `main` (`git fetch origin main`). Land changes via **PR** (main is protected). **Never force-push.**
- **Keep `main` clean** — no temporary/debug workflows or scratch scripts on `main`; use throwaway branches for those.
- Credentials live only in GitHub Actions secrets (`EGYM_USERNAME`, `EGYM_PASSWORD`, `NOTIFY_EMAIL`, `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`, `PRIVATE_REPO_TOKEN`). Never commit secrets. Personal away-dates stay in the private repo only.
